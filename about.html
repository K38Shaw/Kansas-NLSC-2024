                <h3>From Coffee shop conversations to sustainable veteran housing...</h3>
                <p>Two weeks later Ben went back to meet back up with Mike. Ben showed Mike the layout that Clair had worked up for the community, and Brad and Sue’s modified Coventry Bungalow. They went through the projected rent on the studio bungalows and Mike said that was well below anything around and well within his budget. Ben went on to point out and describe all the green space, community gardens and the healthy living gardens planned. Mike asked with a big smile “So, who do you have to be the landscape maintenance person? Have you hired anybody yet?” Ben smiled back and said with an even bigger smile “nope I have been waiting for you to say yes.”
                    <br> <br>Mike responded, “I just have one last thing to ask before I say yes. Can I bring Molly along?” He nodded to where a medium-sized, light brown dog was attentively lying beside his feet. Ben said, “Companion animals will naturally be welcome. But this means you will have to help us design the dog park.” Mike smiled and said, “I’m all in then.”
                   <br> <br> Today we are just about to start the groundbreaking and our plans are to get commitments for the 120 Bungalows at this first site. This particular site is now being referred to as Salveo Communitas ONE as we have been approached with another property in the north part of the city the mayor would like us to consider as our next development. In the past few months we have put together all of the funding to make this community a reality, the only thing missing now is to get the commitments for the tenants who we now refer to as Villagers.
                   <br> <br> Salveo Communitas is affordable housing, not free housing. Our veterans do not need handouts; they need housing that is high value, offers community, and is sustainably priced. Affordable means it fits within their budget. Sustainable means the community, as a whole, generates enough rental income for the homes and common areas to be well maintained, keeping the entire community a beautiful and welcoming place for all our Villagers.</p>
