            <div>
                <h3>From Coffee shop conversations to sustainable veteran housing...</h3>
                <p>How this got started was Ben was out at his favorite coffee shop. As he went in he saw a man outside standing with an Army Veteran hat on. Ben walked over and pointed to his own USMC veteran cap and offered to buy the guy a cup of coffee. The vet said yes and they both sat down to two large coffees and two of the chocolate donuts that Ben cannot resist. They took a table in the front by the window and struck up a conversation. Mike the vet’s name had been in the army and got out a few years before Ben had served.
                    While talking Ben discovered that Mike was homeless and had been homeless for quite some time. Mike opened up on his challenges and what led him to becoming homeless. Medical issues that wiped out his savings, no family, all contributed to not being able to make enough to afford his own place.
                    <br><br>Mike talked about how he could get vouchers to help pay for an apartment, but most landlords do not like to rent to people paying with government vouchers, even when the renter is a vet. “There is a shortage of affordable housing in this city and it is squeezing everyone out of a place to live. I don’t need or even want much. A small studio apartment with a place to cook, heating and AC and something better to sleep on than a cot. I like being outside, and I like to work with my hands and even though it is tough on my back I like to work with maintaining landscapes. So, you would think that a small studio would be easy to find. But that is just not the case. I am grateful for the bed I have now and thankful to the salvation army, but a man of my age, I graduated high school, served my country, got sick, but I am still able to work and love working. It is just tough to be in this situation.” Mike and Ben talked for a while longer when Mike said, “ Great to meet you Ben, but I need to get to my shift here. I got a job coming in and cleaning up after the bakers are done doing all the donuts, cakes and pastries. I come in so they can go home and get some rest, they come in at 2am to start baking six days a week. My job here is only a few hours a day, but it helps me pay for my medicine, and keeps some money in my pocket while I am waiting for spring when I can get more hours working landscape maintenance. There is just something about plants in spring that isn't there.</p>
